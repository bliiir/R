The PDF slides from Coursera are image based instead of text based which means that it is not possible to select the code bits or click the URLS.  

To follow the lecture, I had to reconstruct all the URLs and code snippets anyway and thought they might be useful for others as well

# Storage Systems

## Reading from APIs

### Accessing Twitter from R
First create an app on Twitters [site](https://apps.twitter.com/). Then generate a new token and copy both the consumer key/secret and the access token key/secret.

Load the httr and jsonlite libraries into R
```r
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

Start the authorization process for my app using my consumer credentials
```r
myapp <- oauth_app("twitter",
    key="yourConsumerKeyHere",
    secret="yourConsumerSecretHere", redirect_uri = NULL)
```
Then sign in to the app
```r
sig <- sign_oauth1.0(myapp,
    token = "yourTokenHere",
    token_secret = "yourTokenSecretHere")
```
Use GET to retrieve the json and then store it in an object
```r
homeTL = GET("https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/home_timeline.json", sig)
```
Now parse the json into a variable
```r
json1 <- content(homeTL)
```
Convert it back into json to make it easier to read
```r
json2 <- jsonlite::fromJSON(toJSON(json1))
```
Output the first row of column 1 to 40 to the console
```r
json2[1, 1:4]
```
Voila!
```
